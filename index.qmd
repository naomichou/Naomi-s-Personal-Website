## Bio

Hi! Welcome to my personal website.\n

I'm Naomi Chou, an undergraduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) majoring in Statistics and Data Science with minors in Professional Writing and Digital Humanities. My professional interests lie in the applications of data science in business, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI).\n

I currently work as a Data Science and AI Engineer for Spade AI, a start-up specializing in market intelligence and analysis, and a Data Analyst for Roadrunners Venture Studios, a company focused on commercializing lab technology. I also work at the UCLA Office of Advanced Research Computing as a High Performance Computing (HPC) Systems Intern.\n

Please do not hesitate to reach out to me via Email or LinkedIn. My most recent [CV](/docs/CV/CV.pdf "CV") is linked here!\n


## Interests

In my free time, I enjoy reading science fictions and history books. I'm currently reading "The Three Body Problem" by Liu Cixin, which is an absolutely mind-blowing piece of work. I look forward to reading its sequel! Other books that I enjoy include Pride and Prejudice, the Harry Potter series, and Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind.\n

I also enjoy cooking and baking, with my famous dishes being Taiwanese Braised Pork rice and Banana Bread. Always looking for new recipes to try!
